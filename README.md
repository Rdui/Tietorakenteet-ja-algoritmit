# Tietorakenteet-ja-algoritmit
The code produced during the course tietorakenteet ja algoritmit (datastructures and algorithms).

hw1 contains: Inside the Python folder is a code implementation of using mergesort to sort given data.

hw2 contains: The assignment was to create a hash table and use it as a datastructure for a warehouse.
              The idea of the hash table was to provide a efficient way to store and fetch data.

hw3 contains: Raw data of Tampere public transportation is gathered and set inside a datastructure.
              User can use the datastructure to get the fastest route around Tampere. The fastest
              route is calculated by using Dijkstra algorithm.
